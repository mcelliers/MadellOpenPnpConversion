# MadellOpenPnpConversion
This documents all the hardware and software changed to make the Madell PX3700 work with OpenPnp

This is a work in Progress started on 2023-10-31..

The PX3700 controller will be replaced by the Makerbase MKS Robin Nano V3 Eagle 32Bit 168Mhz F407 Control Board. 
Later I will create my own board (maybe with an ESP32 using fluidnc)

Information on the board is at : https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Robin-Nano-V3.X
( I will test the firmware that comes with the board. I believe it is Marlin V2 but if required i will make some changes)

For all the Upgrade tasks and parts that i requie for this confersion I will place here.
